1. First, define a variable with the value 'John'.

"""
Python 3.6 introduced the f-strings
that allow us to format text strings faster and more elegant.
The f-strings provide a way to embed variables and expressions
inside a string literal using a clearer syntax than
the 'format()' method.

Note! :
- That you need to prefix the string with the letter 'f' to indicate
  that it is an f-string.
  Itâ€™s also valid if you use the letter in uppercase (F).
- Python evaluates the expressions in f-string at runtime.
  It replaces the expressions inside an f-string with their values.

    numbers[0] += value
    return numbers[0]


numbers: list[int] = [0]
result_text = f"{inc(numbers, 1)}, {inc(numbers, 2)}"

"""
Python evaluates the expressions in an f-string
in the left-to-right order.
This is obvious if the expressions have side effects like the example above.

The above example use a f-string to format an integer as hexadecimal.

"""
The following example uses the f-string to format a number as a scientific notation.

pad_number = 200
print(f"{pad_number:06}")
"""
If you want to pad zeros at the beginning of the number, you use the f-string format as above.

result_number = 9.98567
print(f"{result_number: .2f}")
"""
To specify the number of decimal places, you can also use the f-string.
"""

large_number = 400000000000
print(f"{large_number: ,}")
"""
If the number is too large, you can use the number separator to make it easier to read:
"""

percantege_number = 0.1259
print(f"{percantege_number: 0.2%}")
print(f"{percantege_number: 0.1%}")
"""
To format a number as a percentage, you use the following f-string format

"""
Learn about the f-string and how to use them to format strings
and make code more readable.

1. f-string provide an elegant way to format text strings.
2. f-string will replaces the result of an expression embedded inside
   the curly braces {} in an f-string at runtime.
